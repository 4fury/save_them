## Save them!
    
Here I will save some interesting soft. Their development is terminated. I hope someone brings them back to life.
    
**Geh**: once a part of the pekwm project.     
#### Features:
* native GTK+ interface,
* control of several keys,
* thumbnails grid.
    
#### Issues:
There is no file open dialog in the program. There are also some bugs. For example, the rotate function breaks images.
     
**PyBookReader**: this is amazing application. A lucky choice of programming language and high developer's skill allows it to remain relevant for over 13 years after last release.
    
#### Features:
* extensive settings for easy reading,
* automatic scrolling,
* two-page mode.
* text from pdf files is rendering by system settings.
    
**Issues**: Various errors have accumulated by now.
